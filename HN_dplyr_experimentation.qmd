## Rationale

I have previously downloaded TCGA data via TCGA using BioConductr packages that really mess up my workflow. From these effort I have generated RDS files. I would now like to play with these data frames in my usual manner

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
tcga_data <- readRDS("tcga_data.RDS")
names(tcga_data)
isS4(tcga_data)
str(tcga_data)

library(TCGAbiolinks)

getResults(tcga_data)

```
